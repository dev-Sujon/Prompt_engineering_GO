        "Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompting to efficiently use Large Language Model (LLMs) or Large Model (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is not just about designing and developing prompts. It encompasses a wide range of skills and techniques that are useful for interacting and developing with LLMs. It's an important skill to interface, build with, and understand capabilities of LLMs. You can use prompt engineering to improve safety of LLMs and build new capabilities like augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge and external tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "Motivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, we have created this new prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, advanced prompting techniques, learning guides, model-specific prompting guides, lectures, references, new LLM capabilities, and tools related to prompt engineering.\n",

        "# Here are some key aspects of prompt engineering:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Understanding the LLM:** The first step in prompt engineering is to understand the capabilities and limitations of the LLM you are using. This includes understanding the types of tasks the LLM is good at, the types of data it can handle, and the types of prompts that are most effective.\n",
        "* **Crafting the prompt:** The prompt is the key to getting the most out of an LLM. It is important to craft the prompt carefully to ensure that it is clear, concise, and specific. The prompt should also be tailored to the specific task you are trying to accomplish.\n",
        "* **Evaluating the results:** Once you have generated a response from the LLM, it is important to evaluate the results carefully. This includes checking for accuracy, completeness, and relevance. You may also need to iterate on the prompt to improve the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is a powerful tool that can be used to unlock the full potential of LLMs. By understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and by crafting effective prompts, you can use LLMs to solve a wide variety of problems.\n",
